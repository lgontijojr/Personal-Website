# Personal Website

### 🧰 Building The Website
I've been wanting to build a personal website for years now! I finally decided to put sometime and effort and get it done. And it's here. I hope you like it.

#### Stack
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React 

#### 🖌️ Responsive Design
This was fun to work on! This has always been the scariest part for me. Not anymore 🎉 There are three breakpoints:
1. `> 1030px` -> Fullscreen
2. `> 600px < 1030px` -> Tablet
3. `< 600px` -> Mobile

### 🚀 Future Changes
1. The next step is to convert the existing code into TypeScript.
2. I definetely want to improve the design! I'm not a designer (as you can probably tell), so I want to bring in a designer to help me improve the website.

### 🐛 Bugs
No known bugs at the time. Feel free to log issues if you find any 😄

### 📣 Shoutouts
