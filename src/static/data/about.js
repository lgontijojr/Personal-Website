          "Born and raised in Goiânia, Brazil, I immigrated to the United States in 2012 with little comprehension of the English language. I taught myself to read and speak English by consuming countless hours of American media and by practicing amongst peers. My first job in America was a janitor at the local Buffalo Wild Wings. I used this opportunity to further improve my English which landed me a server role and then ultimately a position in management.",
          "I would eventually work as a specialist with Apple in a local retail store where I taught myself Spanish to better communicate with Spanish speaking customers. As my quest for knowledge continued I found myself joining the Year Up program in 2017 which led me to an internship at Slack as a Quality Engineering Intern on the iOS team. My capabilities were quickly acknowledged by leadership which granted me a dual internship with the WebApp team. In two years time I was able to jump from QE Intern to QE Associate and eventually QE Engineer. In the last two years my love for language learning reemerged, naturally shifting me into Software Engineer roles at Slack and now Airtable. I am now proficient in Brazilian Portuguese, English, and Spanish.",
